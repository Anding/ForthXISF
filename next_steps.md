## ForthXISF next steps

1. move the creation of the FITS file to allocate buffer
2. dispense with the XISF buffer and move the necessary elements to he FITS map

1. save files in .png or other format for view in a browser

2. implement some simple transformations

2a. integer binning

2b. abberation inspector

3. create a local broswer webpage to display the images

Perhaps this may be in another repository but which knows the XISF image descriptor (i.e. NEED XISF.f)
Copilot will be a big help with this
