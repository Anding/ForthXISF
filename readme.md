# ForthXISF

Forth package to read and write the XISF file format used by PixInsight.

## Image context

`IMAGE_CONTEXT` is the shared image representation used by XISF, FITS,
preview, analysis, and solver code. `IMAGE_DESCRIPTOR` remains an alias for
compatibility with existing callers.

The context owns dimensions, pixel data, a `FITS_MAP`, and image statistics.
Writers retain their own output paths and update or project the existing
ordered FITS map rather than maintaining separate metadata objects.

## FITS projection and publication

Load the projection vocabulary through the ForthBase manifest:

```forth
NEED FITS_projection
```

The public words are:

```forth
save-FITSprojection    ( -- )
save-FITSprojection-to ( img filepath-buffer -- )
replace-file-atomically ( source-buffer destination-buffer -- )
```

`save-FITSprojection` writes the shared current image through its dedicated
pathname policy and retains the resulting path. `save-FITSprojection-to` is
the explicit low-level form. Both write the ordered FITS map as UTF-8
`key<TAB>value<CRLF>` lines through an in-memory buffer.

`replace-file-atomically` expects ForthBase buffer descriptors containing
source and destination paths. It temporarily appends the required NUL
terminators, calls the native `ReplaceFileAtomic` export, and restores the
retained paths before returning. Replacement exposes the destination only
after a completed temporary manifest exists.

## Output pathname policy

`ForthAstroFormats` provides replaceable complete-path composers:

```forth
s" E:\images" $value astro.root
```

The formats package owns this global root; an observatory environment may
replace it with `$-> astro.root`.

```forth
write-filepath-bmp                ( frame caddr u filepath-buffer -- )
write-filepath-stretched-bmp      ( frame caddr u filepath-buffer -- )
write-filepath-histogram          ( frame caddr u filepath-buffer -- )
write-filepath-preview-manifest   ( frame caddr u filepath-buffer -- )
write-filepath-fits-projection    ( frame caddr u filepath-buffer -- )
write-filepath-metadata-manifest  ( frame caddr u filepath-buffer -- )
write-filepath-xisf               ( frame caddr u filepath-buffer -- )
write-filepath-fits               ( frame caddr u filepath-buffer -- )
write-filepath-wcs                ( frame caddr u filepath-buffer -- )
```

Each writer owns its dedicated deferred pathname creator, retained filepath
buffer, extension, and file I/O. Defaults are assigned when the formats
library loads, so ordinary orchestration only invokes the zero-argument
writers:

Complete-path composers must call `buffer-punctuate-filepath` after the
folder and before the filename. Directory creation rejects buffers without
that recorded boundary rather than passing an invalid length to Windows.

```forth
save-XISFimage
save-FITSimage
```

A private solver temporarily replaces only `write-filepath-fits`, calls
`save-FITSframe-to`, and restores the previous action.

`NEED ForthPublication` loads the generic UUID-path and manifest record words.
It owns binary output, manifest publication, and atomic replacement mechanics.
`NEED ForthPreview` loads the stretched-BMP and histogram writers.

VFXterm is a 32-bit process and must be able to load the Win32 Release
`XISF.dll`. Deploy
`XISF_project\Release\XISF.dll` beside `VFXterm.exe` before exercising any
native XISF export. An unresolved DLL binding can terminate VFX on its first
native call; `FITS_projection_test1.f` verifies the atomic replacement path.

## Preview BMP output

```forth
save-BMPimage ( img bitmap filepath-buffer -- )
```

The native writer saves an 8-bit, top-down grayscale BMP from the high byte of
each 16-bit image sample. The caller supplies the source bitmap and a
ForthBase filepath buffer.

## Tests

`FITS_projection_test1.f` is a standalone `simple-tester` regression suite.
It verifies ordered projection bytes, atomic replacement and source removal,
and XISF/FITS filename generation when `FOCUSPOS` is deliberately empty.
