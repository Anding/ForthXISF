## ForthXISF next steps

1. save files in .png or other format for view in a browser

2. implement some simple transformations

2a. integer binning

2b. abberation inspector

3. create a local broswer webpage to display the images

Perhaps this may be in another repository but which knows the XISF image descriptor (i.e. NEED XISF.f)
Copilot will be a big help with this
